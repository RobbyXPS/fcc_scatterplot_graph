# FCC: Scatterplot Graph

\_A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/EastRobby/pen/bJrxZz](https://codepen.io/EastRobby/pen/bJrxZz).

//Lessons & Tech:

- Data driven document with D3.js library
- Scatterplot graph essentials (dots, tooltips, radius, borders, color)
- Element placement based off of window via d3.event.pageX/pageY
- D3 mm:ss axis
- Share element data from dots to tooltip via d3.select(this)

If you open the /dist/index.html file in a browser, it should look exactly as you built it in CodePen.
